# Flutter Tutorials Repository üöÄ

Welcome to my Flutter Tutorials Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of tutorials that I followed while learning Flutter. These tutorials have been instrumental in honing my skills and building awesome Flutter applications. üéâ

## Tutorials

### 1. Namer App - [Codelabs Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#8)

The Namer App tutorial from Google Codelabs is a fantastic introduction to Flutter. Follow this tutorial to create your own "Namer" app and dive into the world of Flutter widgets and UI design. üì±

### 2. To-Do List - [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ_ytw58tC4&t=6766s)

This comprehensive YouTube tutorial by Mitch Koko takes you through the fundamentals of Flutter and Dart including the process of building a To-Do List app in Flutter. Learn about state management, navigation, and more as you follow along with the engaging tutorial. ‚úîÔ∏è

### 3. Demo Rebuild - [Hands-On Exploration]
Unlike the guided tutorials, my third project involved a self-driven exploration. Without relying on a step-by-step tutorial, I initiated an 'Empty Application' and reconstructed the demo application generated when starting a new 'Application' in Flutter.

This independent endeavor served as a valuable learning experience, providing hands-on exposure to problem-solving and reinforcing acquired knowledge. While overcoming challenges and errors, I honed my skills and gained a more profound understanding of Flutter's intricacies.

Notably, I introduced personal touches to the project, such as implementing a new button for counter clearance and incorporating basic animations to enhance the visual appeal. This approach encourages a deeper engagement with Flutter's features and cultivates a problem-solving mindset essential for real-world applications. üõ†Ô∏è
